`cabal-audit` is a command-line utility that scans Haskell projects for known vulnerabilities based on the 
[security advisories database](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories). 
It checks project dependencies, reports potential vulnerabilities, and provides details about the vulnerabilities, including links to relevant 
advisories and possible fixes.

## Installation

To install `cabal-audit`, you can use Nix by running the following command:

```bash
nix run github:mangoiv/cabal-audit -- --help
```

If you don't use `nix`, you can also build from source with `cabal` or
[download a static executable from one of the latest workflow runs](https://github.com/MangoIV/cabal-audit/releases/tag/nightly).

> [!Note]
> We also have a `cachix`. If you trust me (which I do not recommend, never trust anybody!), run `cachix use cabal-audit` to 
> download directly from the cachix and skip building.

## Usage

Run `cabal-audit` to scan your project for known vulnerabilities:

```console
Î» nix run github:mangoiv/security-advisories/mangoiv/cabal-audit-osv#cabal-audit --

## Features

- **Query vulnerabilities**: Scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Human-readable output**: Displays human-readable results.
- **Machine-readable output**: Displays machine-readable output as json containing osvs.
- **Cabal solver**: Matches vulnerabilities against project dependencies.
- **Fix version suggestion**: Provides fix version or a link to relevant advisories.

## Open Features

- Provide a range of fix versions instead of just the latest.
- Suggest the latest package version on Hackage that is greater than the fix version.
- Additional Cabal solver options.
- More structured monadic code. (also enables disabling colouring)
- upload package on hackage
